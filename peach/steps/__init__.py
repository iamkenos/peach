    bunch of things happening below
    1. call expect on a locator and build expected conditions
    2. optionally set the exception prototype; anything other than an AssertionError will yield a broken test status
       this helps with narrowing down which failures are assertion / test failures and others
    3. optionally set an action to do before checking the built conditions
    4. set a `displayed` condition - this will check whether the locator is visible
    5. set a `true` condition - this will check that the value passed is `True` (which will always fail in the example below)
    6. finally call poll to keep trying both the action and the checks until the configured timeout is reached
    7. the `pg.nav().click()` won't execute, so this test is considered "broken" which is why we set a different
       exception prototyp on step 2 above

    this test should show the first assertion to pass and the second to fail because `False` would never be `True`
